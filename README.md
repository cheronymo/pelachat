# Pelachat 	
Pelachat is a Python tool that allows you to set up an LLM (Large Language Model) to create a chatbot.  
This chatbot answers specific questions because it is trained on a local database. The database is set up from a PDF library. 

## Ollama
Pelachat is based on AI stored on the <a href="[http://example.com/](https://ollama.com/)">Ollama</a> platform. This chatbot uses two different models:
* nomic-embed-text: for the embedding function :open_book:	
* mistral: for the chatbot :robot:
