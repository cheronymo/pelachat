# Pelachat

Pelachat is a Python tool that allows you to set up an LLM (Large Language Model) to create a chatbot.
This chatbot answers specific questions because it is trained on a local database. The database is set up from a PDF library. 

## Ollama
Pelachat is based on AI stored on the Ollama<https://ollama.com/> platform. This chatbot uses two different models:
* nomic-embed-text: for the embedding function
* mistral: for the chatbot
